The Passengers in History data endpoint has been provided using an Apache Solr index (see http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) that uses a Drupal Solr 4.x schema (see https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr). See [https://wiki.apache.org/solr/QueryParametersIndex](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/QueryParametersIndex) for more detail surrounding the query syntax.
<br />
An example of a basic implementation can be viewed at http://data.history.sa.gov.au/gallery_pih.php?type=vessel&startindex=0
<br />
Replace the type parameter with any of the types listed below to return associated images eg. http://data.history.sa.gov.au/gallery_pih.php?type=passenger&startindex=0
<br />
The example code can be downloaded from http://data.history.sa.gov.au/gallery_pih.php.txt
<br />
The open_data index contains 7 different types of content:
<br />
* voyage
* passenger
* vessel
* master
* port
* source
* organisation
<br/>
Additionally, the photo index (photo_index) can be used to retrieve photos (specify the index using the index_id query parameter).
<br/>
A voyage is centric to most other content types contains references to passengers, vessels and ports. A join query should be used to get information about related content (see https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Join for information surrounding the query syntax for joins). 
The is_nid field is the unique identifier.
<br/>
The number of rows per query is limited to 999 so the start and rows query parameters would need to be used to iterate over the entire result set.
<br/>
There are many response formats available (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Response+Writers). Just add the parameter 'wt' to the query and select the response format eg. json or csv. The default is xml.
##Examples##
A typical workflow might be:
<br/>
Get the voyage/s that arrived in 1836:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND is_field_voyage_year:1836](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND is_field_voyage_year:1836)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to get the passengers for one of the voyages (use the voyage is_nid field)
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?start=0&rows=50&q={!join from=im_field_passengers to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?start=0&rows=50&q={!join from=im_field_passengers%20to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find the origin and destination of a particular voyage:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_origin to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_origin to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)

[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_vessel to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_vessel to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find photos of the vessel (using the vessel is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:photo_index AND im_file_usage_list:920026](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:photo_index AND im_file_usage_list:920026)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find out where a vessel was built (using the vessel is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_built_where to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:923958](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_built_where to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:923958)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find the built by organisation for a particular vessel:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_built_by to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:923958](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join%20from=is_field_built_by%20to=is_nid}index_id:open_data%20AND%20is_nid:923958)
<br/><br/>
Get organisation details (using the organisation is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND ss_type:organisation AND is_nid:916199](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data%20AND%20ss_type:organisation%20AND%20is_nid:916199)
<br/><br/>
Or find all vessels built by the organisation (using the organisation is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND is_field_built_by:916199](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data%20AND%20is_field_built_by:916199)
<br/><br/>
##Other Useful Queries
Find all photos that are attached to a passenger:
<br/>
data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_nid to=im_file_usage_list}ss_type:(passenger OR image)
<br/><br/>
Or find all passengers that have a photo attached (the reverse):
<br/>
data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=im_file_usage_list to=is_nid}ss_type:(passenger OR image)
<br/><br/>
All fields are searchable (see listing below). There are many search options using the Apache Solr query syntax. For instance to find all vessels that have the word ‘Adelaide’ in their tm_title field but not the word ‘port’:
<br/>
data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND ss_type:vessel AND tm_title:(adelaide -port)
<br/>
In this case ss_type is specifically set to be ‘vessel’. The – represents negation of the term. There are many more options – refer to a good blog here [http://yonik.com/solr/query-syntax/](http://yonik.com/solr/query-syntax/)
<br/><br/>
Facet search on the voyage destination for a date range between 1834 and 1836:
<br/>
http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?rows=0&q={!join%20from=is_nid%20to=is_field_destination}index_id:open_data&fq=ds_field_depart_date:[1834-01-01T00:00:00Z%20TO%201836-12-31T12:59:59Z]&facet=on&facet.field=is_field_destination
<br/>
In this case use a port search by node to get the titles of the ports eg.(using the first facet):
<br/>
http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data%20AND%20is_nid:887339
<br/>
The answer is most likely to be Sydney!

Initially, hydrographic charts of the [Queensland] coast were published by the British Admiralty, surveys having been undertaken by the Royal Navy. Australia's hydrographic service was subsequently formed on 1 October 1920 as a part of the Royal Australian Navy. The earliest items in this series dating from Flinders' 1802 Chart of Terra Australis, comprise copies of the Admiralty or Royal Navy charts.

Details recorded on hydrographic charts include regular water depth, positions and least depth over all shoals, wrecks, reefs, banks, etc, position of the coastline (HW and LW mark), nature of the bottom, leading lines fixed and sounded, tidal stream measurements and observations, navigation marks, lights and sailing directions, details of wrecks, etc.

While the series provides an historical survey record of the Queensland coast and major rivers and bays, it includes charts current to year 2010, both new charts and resurveys or updates.

In addition to coastal hydrographic charts and charts of bay entrance channels and reach surveys for navigation purposes, the series includes hydrographic survey plans recording improvements or works in progress, for example, dredging, test bores, reclamation, siltation, wharfage or marina proposals. Some land drawings are also included, for example, port land use and facilities.

The charts are loose and while the majority are within A1/B1 size, they vary from small foolscap drawings up to 2A0 dimensions. Original drawings are linen, tracing paper or tracing film while copies are generally photo-sensitive film.

Charts are arranged geographically in two chronological sequences.
Charts up to 1987 are arranged in a numerical sequence and charts from 1987 to 2000 are arranged in an alpha-numerical sequence.
These arrangements are listed below under the following headings: numerical sequence commences; alpha-numerical sequence prefix; geographical area.

1000; B prefix; SE Queensland Coast, 1987 to 1999

State Library of Queensland has digitised all of these portraits. Anyone can search, view, add a comment, and download a high resolution digital file of any of the portraits in One Search, our catalogue. To search for an individual soldier, visit our catalogue: http://bit.ly/1fCPFWZ.

We are also working with the National Archives of Australia to match and connect the soldier portraits with their war service record on the Discovering Anzacs website http://discoveringanzacs.naa.gov.au/. Not all soldiers can be matched, but where this is possible a link to their service record is also available.

You can learn more about the soldier portraits, the digitisation project, and the invaluable contribution of our volunteers here: http://qanzac100.slq.qld.gov.au/showcase/soldier-portraits. To become a digital volunteer with SLQ, visit Pitch In! http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/about-us/pitch-in. 

This dataset currently contains 28,000 records, and will be updated regularly as more portraits are available. Follow this dataset to receive alerts on updates.
