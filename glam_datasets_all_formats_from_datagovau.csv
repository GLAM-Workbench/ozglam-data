Whitby he began to learn the skills of sound navigation and accurate charting.
In 1755 he joined the Royal Navy and steadily advanced. In North America he
took part in the siege of Quebec City, and began coastal surveys of Nova
Scotia and Newfoundland. In 1768 Cook was promoted to become commander of
Endeavour Bark sent to Tahiti to observe the transit of Venus. The Admiralty
in asecret instructionsa asked Cook to find the mythical southern continent.
In 1769 Cook circumnavigated New Zealand, charted its coast and took formal
possession for England. On 19 April 1770 Cook sighted another coastline.
Sailing north Cook landed at Botany Bay. And charted 5000 miles of coastline
with great accuracy. Cook took formal possession of New South Wales for
England. In 1772 Cook led a second expedition to confirm the great south land.
In 1777, Cookas third voyage explored the Pacific coasts of North America and
Siberia. Cook was killed on 14 February 1779 in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii).

This dataset contains transcripts of Cookas journal with corresponding links
to the digitised pages. Where possible, location information has been

"Nearly 30,000 Queensland soldiers had their portrait taken and published in The Queenslander newspaper before embarkation to World War 1. State Library of Queensland has digitised all of these portraits. Anyone can search, view, add a comment, and download a high resolution digital file of any of the portraits in One Search, our catalogue. To search for an individual soldier, visit our catalogue: http://bit.ly/1fCPFWZ.

We are also working with the National Archives of Australia to match and connect the soldier portraits with their war service record on the Discovering Anzacs website http://discoveringanzacs.naa.gov.au/. Not all soldiers can be matched, but where this is possible a link to their service record is also available.

"This index has been compiled by Mrs T. Thompson of Kalgoorlie from the following cemeteries and cemetery records: 

* Old Boulder - Anglican Section of the Cemetery  Board Register 224 names
* Headstones all denominations 41 names
* Roman Catholic 189 names 
* Baptist 12 names 
* Presbyterian 69 names
* Church of Christ 9 names
* General 6 names
* Methodist section 290 names
* Bulong Headstones 19 names
* Kanowna Cemetery Board Register
* Ora Banda Cemetery 
* Siberia Cemetery.

Entry into the index is by name of person being buried and information given is what appears on the headstone or what is transcribed in the burial register. This can include age; relatives eg: parents, wives, husbands, children; date of death,  where lived (from headstone) plus denomination, Officiating clergyman, date of burial, name of Undertaker, residence of friends (if known), remarks (if any), grave number section and subsection (from Register).

The Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia. A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.

The dataset contains: a csv file with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.  

The transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:

* Some cards are missing
* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information
* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not
* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card

"1859 York district Census.  Entry is by name of person, Place of occupation, age, religion, occupation, literacy, arrival ship and date. Details of marriage, wife and children and employer are given.

The Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia. A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.

The dataset contains: several csv files with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.
The transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:

* Some cards are missing
* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information
* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not
* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card
* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.

"This index was compiled by Miss Mollie Bentley from various records she has used relating to the police. These include: Almanac listings, Colonial Secretary's Office Records, Police Gazettes, various police department occurrence books and letter books, police journals, government gazettes, estimates, York police records etc.

Entry is by name of policeman. Information given varies but is usually about appointments, promotions, retirements, transfers etc.

The Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia. A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.

The dataset contains: several csv files with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.

The transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including:

* Some cards are missing
* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information
* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not
* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card
* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.

"The Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia.  A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.  

The dataset contains: several csv files with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.

The transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including: 

* Some cards are missing
* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information
* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not
* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card
* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.

It is still a very valuable dataset as it contains a wealth of information about 
early settlers in Western Australia. It is of particular interest to genealogists and historians


Work began on WABI in the early 1970s when information was sought on people who lived in Western Australian prior to 1914. Publicity was sent out through local libraries, historical groups and in publication such as the West Australian. Western Australians were asked to provide genealogical information, not only on prominent identities, but also from their family records including the arrival in Western Australia, occupations, dates of birth, marriages and deaths of their ancestors. Historical material such as diaries, letters, business records, minute books, maps, family trees and photographs, were also sought for copying.  Entries for the index closed in December 1979, and were filed at the Battye Library for reference.

Western Australians were asked to provide genealogical information, not only on prominent identities, but also from their family records including the arrival in Western Australia, occupations, dates of birth, marriages and deaths of their ancestors. Historical material such as diaries, letters, business records, minute books, maps, family trees and photographs, were also sought for copying.  Entries for the index closed in December 1979, and were filed at the Battye Library for reference.

"The Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia.  A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.     

The transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including: 

* Some cards are missing
* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information
* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not
* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card
* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.

It is still a very valuable dataset as it contains a wealth of information about 
early settlers in Western Australia. It is of particular interest to genealogists and historians

The dataset contains: several csv files with data describing card number, card text and url link to image of the original handwritten card.

Work began on WABI in the early 1970s when information was sought on people who lived in Western Australian prior to 1914. Publicity was sent out through local libraries, historical groups and in publication such as the West Australian. Western Australians were asked to provide genealogical information, not only on prominent identities, but also from their family records including the arrival in Western Australia, occupations, dates of birth, marriages and deaths of their ancestors.

"The Western Australian Biographical Index (WABI) is a highly used resource at the State Library of Western Australia.  A recent generous contribution by the Friends of Battye Library (FOBS) has enabled SLWA to have the original handwritten index cards scanned and later transcribed.     

The transcription was crowd-sourced and we are aware that there are some data quality issues including: 

* Some cards are missing
* Transcripts are crowdsourced so may contain spelling errors and possibly missing information
* Some cards are crossed out. Some of these are included in the collection and some are not
* Some of the cards contain relevant information on the back (usually children of the person mentioned). This info should be on the next consecutive card
* As the information is an index, collected in the 1970s from print material, it is incomplete. It is also unreferenced.

Continuation (since 1993) of annual aerial surveys, to include counts and identification photographs, of Southern Right Whales between Cape Leeuwin (WA) and Ceduna (SA), where wintering animals come close to the coast – adult females to calve, at approximately three-year intervals, other adults and juveniles less regularly. The area is the main wintering ground of a major ‘western’ subpopulation of ‘Australian’ right whales, differing in number and extent of recovery (from 19th century hunting) from an ‘eastern’ subpopulation which so far shows little if any recovery. Counts allow estimation of population trend and current numbers; identification photographs allow estimation of life history parameters.

This project serves to implement a very high priority action in the Australian Government’s Conservation Management Plan for Southern Right Whale (2011-21) – Action Area B1: Measuring and monitoring population recovery; continue to obtain and refine population abundance and trends for the south-west population.

A second major regional focus is Melanesia, especially the island of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Papua Province, Indonesia), with some 6,000 registered specimens.

There is a significant dry skeletal collection of over 1,500 specimens, mostly skulls, and this will continue to be expanded. Since 1980, the great majority of specimens acquired (approx. 40,000) have had tissue samples (mostly liver) taken for genetic and biochemical research. These are held in the S.A.

Data sourced from Australian museums on both the ALA and OZCAM should be identical, but on ALA they are combined with observational data from citizen science initiatives and other sources. Both of those sites make it possible to combine, interrogate and analyse data through web services such as the [Spatial Analysis Portal](http://spatial.ala.org.au/). In the Spatial Portal ALA data can be combined with meteorological and other environmental data sourced from and made accessible by relevant government agencies.

The ALA also has a fully documented [API](http://api.ala.org.au/)

Data about endangered species are either withheld from online publication, or coordinates or other data are obscured on the ALA and OZCAM. In those circumstances more specific information is available directly from SA Museum collection managers if it is genuinely required for research purposes.

SA Museum data can be downloaded in full from the Atlas of Living Australia, or broken down into discipline specific parts (e.g. Herpetology, Mammalogy etc). On download the ALA will request an email address (not mandatory) and a reason for download (mandatory) – this is required to track usage of the ALA data to help data providers determine priorities for upload and improvement.

"There are over 24,000 specimens in this collection, including skulls, skins, skeletons, spirit specimens, photographs and frozen tissue. It includes over 1600 marine mammals and its comprehensiveness makes this collection the best of its kind in Australia. Other strengths of the collection include South Australian arid zone native mammals, many specimens of extinct species such as the thylacine and large numbers of bat species.

The collection has also historical importance as it includes many specimens from early expeditions in Australia and to the subantarctic Islands and Antarctica. Well-known people such as Sir Douglas Mawson, Edgar R. Waite and Hedley Finlayson have contributed to the collection.

The mammal collection includes sub-fossils and remains from owl pellets. This collection consists entirely of Australian material with 20000 - 25000 specimens covering 76 mammal species (including introduced species). The collection is made up of bulk bone deposits from the floor of caves, bones excavated from sinkholes, bones extracted from predator scats (eg. dingoes, foxes and Ghost Bats), pellets from birds of prey, particularly barn owls (both recent and pre-settlement material), and stick nest rat nests and middens. The sub-fossil collection is the second best of its kind in Australia.

The SA Museum manages this dataset using the KE EMu collection management system. It is interpreted into the Darwin Core metadata schema (DwC) and semi-regularly exported to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA: http://www.ala.org.au/) and the Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM: http://www.ozcam.org.au/). Information about Darwin Core can be found here: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm. Data sourced from Australian museums on both the ALA and OZCAM should be identical, but on ALA they are combined with observational data from citizen science initiatives and other sources. 
Both of those sites make it possible to combine, interrogate and analyse data through web services such as the Spatial Analysis Portal (http://spatial.ala.org.au/). In the Spatial Portal ALA data can be combined with meteorological and other environmental data sourced from and made accessible by relevant government agencies. 

Data about endangered species are either withheld from online publication, or coordinates or other data are obscured on the ALA and OZCAM. In those circumstances more specific information is available directly from SA Museum collection managers if it is genuinely required for research purposes.

The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery is the leading repository of natural
history collections in Tasmania.

The zoological collections serve as taxonomic reference specimens, vouchers
for biogeographical data and include irreplaceable specimens of extinct
animals and historically significant items.

TMAGas zoology collection of over 125,000 specimens represents the diversity
of the Stateas fauna. This includes important type specimens, historical
taxidermy and rare and extinct animals such as the Thylacine (the Tasmanian
Tiger) and Tasmanian Emu.

The research collection is speciman-based and also includes tissue samples for
molecular research.

The Tasmanian Herbariumas collection of plant specimens is the largest and
most comprehensive record of the Tasmanian flora in the world. Collections
date from the first arrival of Europeans in the late 18th Century to the
present day. The collection also includes numerous specimens from other parts
of the world and the Australian mainland, especially in non-vascular plants.

Two thirds of the [Australian Antarctic Division
Herbarium](http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/174) (ADT), is now
incorporated into the Tasmanian Herbarium (HO), This ADT collection includes
bryophytes, lichens, vascular flora mainly from Antarctica and the
Subantarctic islands.

"##Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-1915

In August 1914 war broke out across Europe. Within days ‘enemy subjects’ in Australia were required to register with the authorities. Most gave their ‘parole’ and went on with their lives in the community, but internment started with sailors taken off enemy ships and enemy reservists, and went on to include enemy subjects suspected of ‘disloyal or unsatisfactory’ behaviour. Later, some naturalised British subjects and even natural-born British subjects were interned. In the course of the war over 6,000 enemy subjects were interned across Australia. 

This dataset contains information about individuals interned during the First World War from South Australia (Military District 4). Most of those interned between October 1914 and August 1915, some 400 men, were held on Torrens Island, in the Port River estuary, north-west of Adelaide. The data set also includes those from South Australia who were interned in New South Wales after Torrens Island internment camp closed in August 1915.

The data was compiled by History SA staff from two archival series in the National Archives of Australia: A367 C18000 Part 1, War Internees and Deportees 1914-1919 and D2286, Nominal Roll of prisoners of war interned at Torrens Island concentration camp 1915. Data fields include: Name, Also recorded as (alternative name), Date interned, Interned (at), Nationality, Date of birth/age, Remarks, and Notes. The data has been produced by identifying individuals who appear in both series and combining information from both series into this data set, using the A367 data as the primary series. This involved interpreting the data, in particular, making an assessment of whether or not entries in the two series with similar names represent the same person. Further research may reveal some of these assessments to be inaccurate.

The dataset was produced as part of research for an exhibition at the Migration Museum and the Wakefield Press publication Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-15.

"The collection comprises 2,558 glass negatives from Bond Studios in Port Adelaide.  AE Bond was listed as a photographer in Commercial Road, Port Adelaide from 1901, although state collections include photographs credited to Bond that date back to 1867.  In the 1930s the business shifted to St Vincent Street.  The negatives are studio portraits of generations of Portonians.  They capture individual rites of passage such as weddings, graduations, debuts, birthdays, and soldiers and sailors departing for war. Most of the negatives are labeled with surnames so it is possible to identify the subjects with further research.

"_Passengers in History_ brings together two wonderful resources:
<br /><br />
A passengers data base developed by the SA Maritime Museum,
A list of ships’ logs and diaries, titled Log of Logs.
<br /><br />
The passengers data base was produced by staff and volunteers at the South Australian Maritime Museum over 20 years. It includes entries for 328,000 passengers and 20,000 voyages to South Australia between 1836 and 1961.
<br /><br />
This data set is presented as a search index that can expose most open data formats.",2016-06-28T00:52:30Z,2017-07-28T07:37:54Z,Passengers in History,http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select,1961-01-01T00:00Z,"#Passengers in History API Documentation#
The Passengers in History data endpoint has been provided using an Apache Solr index (see http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) that uses a Drupal Solr 4.x schema (see https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr). See [https://wiki.apache.org/solr/QueryParametersIndex](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/QueryParametersIndex) for more detail surrounding the query syntax.
<br />
An example of a basic implementation can be viewed at http://data.history.sa.gov.au/gallery_pih.php?type=vessel&startindex=0
<br />
Replace the type parameter with any of the types listed below to return associated images eg. http://data.history.sa.gov.au/gallery_pih.php?type=passenger&startindex=0
<br />
The example code can be downloaded from http://data.history.sa.gov.au/gallery_pih.php.txt
<br />
The open_data index contains 7 different types of content:
<br />
* voyage
* passenger
* vessel
* master
* port
* source
* organisation
<br/>
Additionally, the photo index (photo_index) can be used to retrieve photos (specify the index using the index_id query parameter).
<br/>
A voyage is centric to most other content types contains references to passengers, vessels and ports. A join query should be used to get information about related content (see https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Join for information surrounding the query syntax for joins). 
The is_nid field is the unique identifier.
<br/>
The number of rows per query is limited to 999 so the start and rows query parameters would need to be used to iterate over the entire result set.
<br/>
There are many response formats available (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Response+Writers). Just add the parameter 'wt' to the query and select the response format eg. json or csv. The default is xml.
##Examples##
A typical workflow might be:
<br/>
Get the voyage/s that arrived in 1836:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND is_field_voyage_year:1836](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND is_field_voyage_year:1836)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to get the passengers for one of the voyages (use the voyage is_nid field)
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?start=0&rows=50&q={!join from=im_field_passengers to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?start=0&rows=50&q={!join from=im_field_passengers%20to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find the origin and destination of a particular voyage:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_origin to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_origin to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_destination to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_destination to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find the vessel for the voyage:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_vessel to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_vessel to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:944632)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find photos of the vessel (using the vessel is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:photo_index AND im_file_usage_list:920026](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:photo_index AND im_file_usage_list:920026)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find out where a vessel was built (using the vessel is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_built_where to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:923958](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_built_where to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:923958)
<br/><br/>
Use a join to find the built by organisation for a particular vessel:
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_field_built_by to=is_nid}index_id:open_data AND is_nid:923958](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join%20from=is_field_built_by%20to=is_nid}index_id:open_data%20AND%20is_nid:923958)
<br/><br/>
Get organisation details (using the organisation is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND ss_type:organisation AND is_nid:916199](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data%20AND%20ss_type:organisation%20AND%20is_nid:916199)
<br/><br/>
Or find all vessels built by the organisation (using the organisation is_nid):
<br/>
[http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND is_field_built_by:916199](http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data%20AND%20is_field_built_by:916199)
<br/><br/>
##Other Useful Queries
Find all photos that are attached to a passenger:
<br/>
data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=is_nid to=im_file_usage_list}ss_type:(passenger OR image)
<br/><br/>
Or find all passengers that have a photo attached (the reverse):
<br/>
data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q={!join from=im_file_usage_list to=is_nid}ss_type:(passenger OR image)
<br/><br/>
All fields are searchable (see listing below). There are many search options using the Apache Solr query syntax. For instance to find all vessels that have the word ‘Adelaide’ in their tm_title field but not the word ‘port’:
<br/>
data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data AND ss_type:vessel AND tm_title:(adelaide -port)
<br/>
In this case ss_type is specifically set to be ‘vessel’. The – represents negation of the term. There are many more options – refer to a good blog here [http://yonik.com/solr/query-syntax/](http://yonik.com/solr/query-syntax/)
<br/><br/>
Facet search on the voyage destination for a date range between 1834 and 1836:
<br/>
http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?rows=0&q={!join%20from=is_nid%20to=is_field_destination}index_id:open_data&fq=ds_field_depart_date:[1834-01-01T00:00:00Z%20TO%201836-12-31T12:59:59Z]&facet=on&facet.field=is_field_destination
<br/>
In this case use a port search by node to get the titles of the ports eg.(using the first facet):
<br/>
http://data.history.sa.gov.au:8983/solr/passengers/select?q=index_id:open_data%20AND%20is_nid:887339
<br/>
The answer is most likely to be Sydney!
