# GLAM datasets from government data portals

Notebooks and harvested data relating to my attempts to extract information about GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) datasets from government data portals.

See [GLAM Workbench for summaries and details](https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-portals/).

For more Australian GLAM data see [Sources of Australian GLAM data](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-data-list).
