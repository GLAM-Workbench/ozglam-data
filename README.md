# OzGLAM Data

I'm trying to assemble some information about Oz GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) datasets.

As a first step, I've harvested GLAM-related datasets from the various national and state data portals. I did this by identifying relevant organisations and groups, and then harvesting all the packages associated with them. I also added in a few extra packages that looked relevant.

You can explore the [harvesting methodology in this notebook](GLAM data from gov portals.ipynb).

I've created [a CSV of all the CSV-formatted datasets](gov-glam-datasets.csv) I found. There are duplicates in the list because some datasets are listed on more than one portal. While my interested is in datasets containing collection data, the list also includes datasets created by the operations of GLAM organisations.
