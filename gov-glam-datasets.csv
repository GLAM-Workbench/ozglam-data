Initially, hydrographic charts of the [Queensland] coast were published by the British Admiralty, surveys having been undertaken by the Royal Navy. Australia's hydrographic service was subsequently formed on 1 October 1920 as a part of the Royal Australian Navy. The earliest items in this series dating from Flinders' 1802 Chart of Terra Australis, comprise copies of the Admiralty or Royal Navy charts.

Details recorded on hydrographic charts include regular water depth, positions and least depth over all shoals, wrecks, reefs, banks, etc, position of the coastline (HW and LW mark), nature of the bottom, leading lines fixed and sounded, tidal stream measurements and observations, navigation marks, lights and sailing directions, details of wrecks, etc.

While the series provides an historical survey record of the Queensland coast and major rivers and bays, it includes charts current to year 2010, both new charts and resurveys or updates.

In addition to coastal hydrographic charts and charts of bay entrance channels and reach surveys for navigation purposes, the series includes hydrographic survey plans recording improvements or works in progress, for example, dredging, test bores, reclamation, siltation, wharfage or marina proposals. Some land drawings are also included, for example, port land use and facilities.

The charts are loose and while the majority are within A1/B1 size, they vary from small foolscap drawings up to 2A0 dimensions. Original drawings are linen, tracing paper or tracing film while copies are generally photo-sensitive film.

Charts are arranged geographically in two chronological sequences.
Charts up to 1987 are arranged in a numerical sequence and charts from 1987 to 2000 are arranged in an alpha-numerical sequence.
These arrangements are listed below under the following headings: numerical sequence commences; alpha-numerical sequence prefix; geographical area.

State Library of Queensland has digitised all of these portraits. Anyone can search, view, add a comment, and download a high resolution digital file of any of the portraits in One Search, our catalogue. To search for an individual soldier, visit our catalogue: http://bit.ly/1fCPFWZ.

We are also working with the National Archives of Australia to match and connect the soldier portraits with their war service record on the Discovering Anzacs website http://discoveringanzacs.naa.gov.au/. Not all soldiers can be matched, but where this is possible a link to their service record is also available.

You can learn more about the soldier portraits, the digitisation project, and the invaluable contribution of our volunteers here: http://qanzac100.slq.qld.gov.au/showcase/soldier-portraits. To become a digital volunteer with SLQ, visit Pitch In! http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/about-us/pitch-in. 

This dataset currently contains 28,000 records, and will be updated regularly as more portraits are available. Follow this dataset to receive alerts on updates.
